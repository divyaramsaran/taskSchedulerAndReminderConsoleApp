# Project Title

**TimeKeeper: Task Scheduler & Reminder Console App**

---

## Overview

Create a console-based Task Scheduler and Reminder application using JavaScriptâ€™s `setTimeout()` and `setInterval()` functions. This project will help you understand asynchronous code execution, scheduling tasks, and managing periodic and delayed events in JavaScript.

---

## Functional Requirements

- **Add Task with Reminder:**  
  Users can add tasks with a description and a reminder time (in seconds or minutes).  
  The app should display a reminder message when the time is up (using `setTimeout`).

- **Recurring Reminders:**  
  Users can set up recurring reminders for specific tasks (e.g., "Drink Water every 30 minutes") using `setInterval`.

- **Cancel Reminders:**  
  Users can cancel any scheduled or recurring reminder.

- **List All Tasks:**  
  Display all scheduled tasks, their status (pending, completed, recurring), and remaining time.

- **Mark Task as Completed:**  
  Users can mark a task as completed, which should cancel any pending reminders for that task.
